    "A ceremony where a Bride chooses her Groom from an array of eligible bachelors is called Swayamvar. But this is a Swayamvar with difference. An array of Bride-to-be will choose from an array of Groom-to-be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrangement at this Swayamvar is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "· Brides-to-be are organized such that the most eligible bachelorette will get first chance to choose her Groom. Only then, the next most eligible bachelorette will get a chance to choose her Groom\n",
    "\n",
    "· If the initial most eligible bachelorette does not get a Groom of her choice, none of the Brides-to-be have any chance at all to get married. So unless a senior bachelorette is out of the “queue”, the junior bachelorette does not get a chance to select her Groom-to-be\n",
    "\n",
    "· Inital state of Grooms-to-be is such that most eligible bachelor is at the head of the “queue”. The next most eligible bachelor is next in the queue. So on and so forth.\n",

    "· Now everything hinges on the choice of the bachelorette. The most eligible bachelorette will now meet the most eligible bachelor.\n",
    "\n",
    "· If bachelorette selects the bachelor, both, the bachelorette and the bachelor are now Bride and Groom respectively and will no longer be a part of the Swayamvar activity. Now, the next most eligible bachelorette will get a chance to choose her Groom. Her first option is the next most eligible bachelor (relative to initial state)\n",
    "\n",
    "· If the most eligible bachelorette passes the most eligible bachelor, the most eligible bachelor now moves to the end of the queue. The next most eligible bachelor is now considered by the most eligible bachelorette. Selection or Passing over will have the same consequences as explained earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "· If most eligible bachelorette reaches the end of bachelor queue, then the Swayamvar is over. Nobody can get married.\n",
    "\n",
    "· Given a mix of Selection or Passing over, different pairs will get formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection criteria is as follows\n",

    "CODU loves to play with a string of brackets. He considers string as a good string if it is balanced with stars. A string is considered as balanced with stars if the string contains balanced brackets and between every pair of bracket i.e. between opening and closing brackets, there are at least 2 stars(*) present. CODU knows how to check whether a string is balanced or not but this time he needs to keep a track of stars too. He decided to write a program to check whether a string is good or not. But CODU is not as good in programming as you are, so he decided to take help from you. Will you help him with this task? You need to print Yes and number of balanced pair if string satisfies following conditions(string is good if it satisfies following 2 conditions):\n",

    "1. The string is balanced with respect to all brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Between every pair of brackets, there are at least two stars.\n",

    "His target is to have the maximum protein, carbohydrates and fats in his diet without exceeding the prescribed limit. He also wants to have as much diverse food items as much as possible. That is, he does not want to have many units of one food item and 0 of others. Multiple combinations of 'units of food items' are possible to achieve the target. Mathematically speaking, diversity is more if the difference between the number of units of food item chosen the most and the number of units of another food item chosen the least, is as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, he uses maximum possible number of units of all the items so that total amount of protein, carbohydrates and fats is not more than prescribed limit. For example - if total nutrition required is 100P, 130C and 130F (where P is Protein, C is Carbohydrates and F is Fats) and 2 different food items, viz.

    "Next, he chooses food items to fulfill the remaining nutrients. He chooses one more units of maximum number of food items. He continues this process till he cannot add a unit of any food item to his diet without exceeding the prescribed limit. In this example, he can choose one more unit of item B or one more unit of item A. In case he has two sets of food items then the priority is given to fulfill the requirements of Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats in that order. So he chooses item B.\n",
